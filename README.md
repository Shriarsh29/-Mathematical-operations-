# -Mathematical-operations-
A Python-based toolkit for mathematical operations including HCF, LCM, volume of a sphere, perfect number check, palindromic number check, sum of n natural numbers, stair and inverted stair patterns, descending order sort, and highest/lowest number check. Designed for educational use.
Mathematical Operations Toolkit
This project is a Python-based toolkit that performs a variety of mathematical operations, including:

HCF (Highest Common Factor): Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
LCM (Least Common Multiple): Finds the smallest common multiple for given numbers.
Volume of a Sphere: Computes the volume of a sphere using the standard mathematical formula.
Perfect Number Check: Determines if a number is a perfect number.
Palindromic Number Check: Checks if a number is a palindrome.
Sum of First n Natural Numbers: Calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers.
Stair and Inverted Number Stair Pattern: Generates stair and inverted number stair patterns.
Descending Order Number Sort: Sorts numbers in descending order.
Highest and Lowest Number Check: Identifies the highest and lowest numbers from a list.
Features
Comprehensive mathematical calculations and pattern generation.
Efficient and accurate algorithms.
Modular design for easy customization and expansion.
